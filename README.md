# SMART (Synchronous Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Tool)

SMART is an intelligent API monitoring system that leverages machine learning and context awareness to provide advanced monitoring capabilities.

## Features

- Intelligent metric analysis with weighted percentiles
- ML-powered anomaly detection
- Context-aware monitoring
- Adaptive thresholds
- Business impact analysis
- Resource-efficient architecture

## Notes

This repository contains a conceptual architecture for an intelligent API monitoring system. While the code provides a complete reference implementation, it is intended as a blueprint that developers can use to:

- Understand the concepts behind intelligent API monitoring
- Explore possible implementations
- Adapt the architecture to their specific needs
- Build their own monitoring solutions

## Purpose

This is not a production-ready implementation but rather a thought experiment in how we might build more intelligent monitoring systems. The code demonstrates architectural patterns and approaches that can be adapted and enhanced for specific use cases.
